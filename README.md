## Description
The goal of this project is to give the user the possibility to process lots of news information in the compressed form. The model we choose to explore was __LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)__. It is a soft-clustering algorithm. It is a natural choice for topic modeling, as usually, our texts consisting of more than just one topic.

## Data
**Yo can get dataset which we used for training our model here**
> [“Most popular news 2017” by Webhose](https://webhose.io/free-datasets/popular-news-articles/)

## Installing
### Possible troubles with installation
Since we used library [**pattern**](https://pypi.org/project/pattern3/) it is possible to faсe the error during installation:
> EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found

**Solution**:
* Ubuntu/Debian based distros:

```sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev```

or

```sudo apt install default-libmysqlclient-dev```
* Arch based distros:
> Install libmysqlclient from AUR

* For Windows/MacOS/other distros you should find your way to install mysqlclient.
